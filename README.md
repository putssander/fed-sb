# Fed-SB: A Silver Bullet for Extreme Communication Efficiency and Performance in (Private) Federated LoRA Fine-Tuning


## Introduction

Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become ubiquitous for efficiently fine-tuning foundation models. However, federated fine-tuning of LoRA remains challenging due to non-optimal updates arising from traditional federated averaging of individual adapters. Existing solutions either incur prohibitively high communication cost that scales linearly with the number of clients or suffer from performance degradation due to limited expressivity. We introduce **Federated Silver Bullet (Fed-SB)**, a novel approach for federated fine-tuning of LLMs using LoRA-SB, a recently proposed low-rank adaptation method. LoRA-SB learns a rxr matrix between B and A, while keeping other components fixed. Direct averaging of R guarantees exact updates, substantially reducing communication cost, which remains independent of the number of clients, and enables scalability. Fed-SB achieves state-of-the-art performance across commonsense reasoning, arithmetic reasoning, and language inference tasks while reducing communication costs by up to **230x**. In private settings, Fed-SB further improves performance by (1) reducing trainable parameters, thereby lowering the noise required for differential privacy, and (2) avoiding noise amplification introduced by other methods. Overall, Fed-SB establishes a new Pareto frontier in performance vs. communication cost, offering an efficient and scalable solution for both private and non-private federated fine-tuning.

## Environment Setup

First, create and activate a Conda environment with Python 3.10, then install the necessary libraries by running:

```bash
conda create -n fed-sb python=3.10
conda activate fed-sb
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
cd fed_sb
```

## Arithmetic Reasoning

To fine-tune a model on the MetaMathQA dataset and evaluate its performance on GSM8K and MATH benchmarks, execute the following script:

```bash
bash fed/scripts/arithmetic.sh
```

You can modify the `BASE_MODEL` parameter within the script to experiment with different models.

## Commonsense Reasoning

### Dataset Preparation

1. **Fine-tuning Data:**  
   Download the fine-tuning dataset from [this link](https://github.com/AGI-Edgerunners/LLM-Adapters/blob/main/ft-training_set/commonsense_170k.json) and place it in the `data/commonsense` directory.

2. **Evaluation Data:**  
   Download the evaluation datasets from [this repository](https://github.com/AGI-Edgerunners/LLM-Adapters/tree/main/dataset). Save each dataset in its corresponding subdirectory under `data/commonsense`.

### Running the Experiments

Once the datasets are in place, run the experiments with:

```bash
bash fed/scripts/cr.sh
```

This script fine-tunes a model on the Commonsense170K dataset and evaluates it across eight different datasets. The `BASE_MODEL` parameter is configurable, allowing you to test various models.

## Privacy-Preserving Fine-Tuning

### Dataset Preparation

Download the SNLI dataset from [this link](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/snli/snli_1.0.zip), unzip it, and store the contents in the `DP/SNLI/data` directory.

### Running the Experiments

There are two scenarios for privacy-preserving fine-tuning:

- **Centralized Private Fine-Tuning:**  
  Run the following script:

  ```bash
  bash DP/SNLI/scripts/central_private.sh
  ```

- **Federated Private Fine-Tuning:**  
  Run the following script:

  ```bash
  bash DP/SNLI/scripts/fed_private.sh
  ```

In both cases, you can adjust the `epsilon` parameter as needed to tune the level of privacy.
